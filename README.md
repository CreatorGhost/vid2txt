### Documentation: vid2txt - Docker-based Video to Text Transcription

This document provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and operating vid2txt, a Docker-encapsulated tool designed for converting video files into text transcriptions. By leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model, vid2txt facilitates a seamless transcription process across various operating systems without necessitating manual configuration of the environment.

#### Overview

vid2txt automates the conversion of video files into text by first extracting the audio component, then transcribing this audio into text using the Whisper model, and finally saving the output as a text file. This entire workflow is contained within a Docker container, simplifying the process to a single requirement: having Docker installed on the user's machine.

#### Tools and Technologies

  

-  **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.

-  **Python**: The programming language used to write the transcription script.

-  **moviepy**: A Python library for video editing, used to extract audio from video files.

-  **whisper**: OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition, used for transcribing audio to text.

-  **FFmpeg**: A multimedia framework to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play almost anything that humans and machines have created. It is used by moviepy for processing video and audio.

  

#### Setup Process

  

1.  **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Installation guides for different operating systems are available on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

  

2.  **Prepare the Python Script ([main.py])**: This script should include functions to extract audio from the video, transcribe the audio using Whisper, and save the transcription to a text file. It uses `argparse` to accept command-line arguments for the video file path and the output text file path.

  

3.  **Create a [Dockerfile]**: This file defines the Docker image, including the base image, installation of dependencies (like FFmpeg and Python libraries), and setting up the environment to run the Python script.

  

4.  **Build the Docker Image**: Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from the `Dockerfile`. This image includes all the necessary dependencies and environment setup.

  

5.  **Run the Transcription Tool**: Use a bash script (`run_transcription.sh`) to simplify the process of running the Docker container. This script checks if the Docker image exists, builds it if necessary, maps the video and output text file paths from the host to the container, and runs the container.

  
  

#### Commands and How They Function

 

-  **Running the Transcription Tool**:

```bash

./run_transcription.sh path/to/video.mp4 path/to/output.txt

```

This command executes the `run_transcription.sh` script with the video file path and the desired output text file path as arguments. The script automates the process of running the Docker container with the correct volume mappings and arguments.

  

#### Detailed Functionality

 

1.  **Audio Extraction**: The `moviepy` library extracts the audio track from the video file and saves it as an audio file.

  

2.  **Transcription**: The Whisper model processes the audio file, transcribing the spoken words into text.

  

3.  **Saving the Transcription**: The transcribed text is saved to the specified output text file.

  

4.  **Docker Container**: Encapsulates the Python environment and dependencies, ensuring the tool runs consistently across different systems. The container accesses video and text files on the host system through Docker volume mappings, allowing for seamless input/output operations.

  

#### Conclusion

This tool provides a streamlined, system-agnostic method for transcribing video files to text. By leveraging Docker, it simplifies the setup process, making it accessible to users without requiring detailed knowledge of Python environments or dependencies.
