### Documentation: Video to Text Transcription Tool Using Docker

  

This document outlines the process, tools, and commands used to set up and run a video to text transcription tool encapsulated within a Docker container. This setup allows users to transcribe video files to text using OpenAI's Whisper model, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems without the need for manual environment setup.

  

#### Overview

  

The tool extracts audio from a video file, transcribes the audio to text using the Whisper model, and saves the transcription to a text file. The entire process is automated within a Docker container, requiring only Docker to be installed on the user's system.

  

#### Tools and Technologies

  

-  **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.

-  **Python**: The programming language used to write the transcription script.

-  **moviepy**: A Python library for video editing, used to extract audio from video files.

-  **whisper**: OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition, used for transcribing audio to text.

-  **FFmpeg**: A multimedia framework to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play almost anything that humans and machines have created. It is used by moviepy for processing video and audio.

  

#### Setup Process

  

1.  **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Installation guides for different operating systems are available on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

  

2.  **Prepare the Python Script ([main.py])**: This script should include functions to extract audio from the video, transcribe the audio using Whisper, and save the transcription to a text file. It uses `argparse` to accept command-line arguments for the video file path and the output text file path.

  

3.  **Create a [Dockerfile]**: This file defines the Docker image, including the base image, installation of dependencies (like FFmpeg and Python libraries), and setting up the environment to run the Python script.

  

4.  **Build the Docker Image**: Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from the `Dockerfile`. This image includes all the necessary dependencies and environment setup.

  

5.  **Run the Transcription Tool**: Use a bash script (`run_transcription.sh`) to simplify the process of running the Docker container. This script checks if the Docker image exists, builds it if necessary, maps the video and output text file paths from the host to the container, and runs the container.

  
  

#### Commands and How They Function

 

-  **Running the Transcription Tool**:

```bash

./run_transcription.sh path/to/video.mp4 path/to/output.txt

```

This command executes the `run_transcription.sh` script with the video file path and the desired output text file path as arguments. The script automates the process of running the Docker container with the correct volume mappings and arguments.

  

#### Detailed Functionality

 

1.  **Audio Extraction**: The `moviepy` library extracts the audio track from the video file and saves it as an audio file.

  

2.  **Transcription**: The Whisper model processes the audio file, transcribing the spoken words into text.

  

3.  **Saving the Transcription**: The transcribed text is saved to the specified output text file.

  

4.  **Docker Container**: Encapsulates the Python environment and dependencies, ensuring the tool runs consistently across different systems. The container accesses video and text files on the host system through Docker volume mappings, allowing for seamless input/output operations.

  

#### Conclusion

This tool provides a streamlined, system-agnostic method for transcribing video files to text. By leveraging Docker, it simplifies the setup process, making it accessible to users without requiring detailed knowledge of Python environments or dependencies.
